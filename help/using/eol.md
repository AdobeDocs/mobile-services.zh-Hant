# Adobe Mobile Services end-of-life FAQ

****

## What is happening?

Mobile Services reaches end-of-life on December 31, 2022. Mobile Services, which supports a mobile-centric UI, acquisition, deep linking, in-app messaging, push notification, and geo-location is no longer supported after this date.

## What is included, and what is not included?

[](https://mobilemarketing.adobe.com)The Mobile version 4 SDKs that rely on this interface were sunset on August 31, 2021.

This end-of-life does NOT include Adobe Analytics for mobile apps, part of the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs. These features, which include in-app behavior, lifecycle analysis, messaging interaction tracking, and audience profiles, continue to receive support from Adobe.

## Why is the capability being retired?

As Adobe continues to expand its mobile marketing capabilities, features previously available in Mobile Services will be released in Adobe Experience Cloud solutions or offered through Adobe Exchange Premier Partners. This transition provides you with more powerful and flexible mobile marketing capabilities.

## What happens to existing processing rules created in Mobile Services?
